- intructions & description
  - emphasize this extension saves chats while the stream page is open and the extension is open. 
    - (explain chrome extension storage) The rants are saved (accessed by JSON text file) to the extension, so the extension must be running during the stream.
    - Page refresh will not lose rants, as rants are saved to storage.
- add json viewer
- maybe add a feature to load json list of rants
  - include instructions and how the json must be formatted
- new rant alert
- figure out how to get tabs to stay open
